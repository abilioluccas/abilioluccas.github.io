### About me
Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by understanding how things work. <br>
As a child, my nickname was “Mad Scientist” because I often took apart old electronics.
Curiosity and persistence have always been part of me.
My journey took me through several paths, where I achieved significant results and improved my interpersonal skills and resilience.
Now I'm looking for a challenge that will allow me to continue learning and evolving as a junior full-stack developer
